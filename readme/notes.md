 - labels can be added to the axes  
 - a title can be added to the plot  
 - a legend can be shown when plotting multiple data sets

## Future Ideas
Under request:
 - high resolution markers available on Windows and other rarer terminals (under request and not sure how)
 - add bar alignment parameter (if requested)
 - `clear_settings()` function to clear only the plot settings (labels, title and so on) and not the data, and colors
 - add `xside` and `yside` to `candlestick()` function
 - `matrix_plot()` side bar to connect intensity level with actual value
